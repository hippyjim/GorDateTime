GorDateTime

An implementation of a saner calendar, as a drop-in replacement for PHPs DateTime object.

Use this object in the same way as you'd use PHP DateTime - with the added bonus of a sensible date structure when you use the gormat() method instead of the format() method

All credit for the sensible Gormanic calendar goes to Dave Gorman https://twitter.com/DaveGorman

Do with it what you will - except use it to buy Twitter followers or anything that involves Alan Sugar.
